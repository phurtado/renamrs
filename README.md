# Renamrs

File renamer written in Rust. 
Copies the files in a folder so that their names become the name of the folder plus a sequence number.

## Remarks

This is my first Rust project and it's probably very poorly written. But what I've noticed is that, although it took ages to get this to compile, once it did, it did exactly what I expected.
